            <h3 style="   margin-top: 100px;">What is <span style="color: black;font-size: 4rem;">paediatric occupational therapy?</span></h3>
            <p>Paediatric occupational therapy applies specialist approaches and techniques to maximise a child’s engagement, achievement and independence in all activities, including those at school, play, leisure and self care skills such as dressing and feeding.</p>
            <p>Our paediatric occupational therapists work with babies, children and teenagers up to the age of 18. With an expert understanding of child development and paediatric conditions, they analyse why a child may be struggling to carry out specific tasks to then devise a bespoke treatment plan to address the specific issues.</p>
