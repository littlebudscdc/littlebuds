            <h2><span style="color: #12c2b9;">Gross Motor</span> Skills</h2>
            <p>Gross motor (physical) skills are those which require whole body movement and which involve the large (core stabilising) muscles of the body to perform everyday functions, such as standing and walking, running and jumping, and sitting upright at the table. They also includes eye-hand coordination skills such as ball skills (throwing, catching, kicking) as well as riding a bike or a scooter and swimming.</p>
            <p>At our facility, we provide a variety of engaging activities and exercises designed to enhance gross motor skills in a fun and supportive environment. Our experienced instructors guide children through age-appropriate activities that challenge and encourage their motor development.</p>

            <h2><span style="color: #12c2b9;">Fine Motor</span> Skills</h2>
            <p>Fine motor skills involve the use of the smaller muscle of the hands, commonly in activities like using pencils, scissors, construction with lego or duplo,  doing up buttons and opening lunch boxes.Fine motor skill efficiency significantly influences the quality of the task outcome as well as the speed of task performance. Efficient fine motor skills require a number of independent skills to work together to appropriately manipulate the object or perform the task. </p>
            <p>Fine motor skills are crucial for daily living tasks and also play a significant role in academic and vocational activities. Activities like drawing, coloring, playing with blocks, and using scissors can help children develop and improve their fine motor skills.</p>

            <h2><span style="color: #12c2b9;">Visual </span> Perception</h2>
            <p>Visual perception refers to the brain’s ability to make sense of what the eyes see. This is not the same as visual acuity which refers to how clearly a person sees (for example “20/20 vision”). A person can have 20/20 vision and still have problems with visual perceptual processing.</p>
            <p>Good visual perceptual skills are important for many every day skills such as reading, writing, completing puzzles, cutting, drawing, completing math problems, dressing, finding your sock on the bedroom floor as well as many other skills. Without the ability to complete these every day tasks, a child’s self esteem can suffer and their academic and play performance is compromised.</p>

            <h2><span style="color: #12c2b9;">Self-Care </span> Activities</h2>
            <p>Self care skills are the everyday tasks undertaken to be ready to participate in life activities (including dressing, eating, cleaning teeth and more). They are often referred to as the activities of daily living (ADL’s). While these are typically supported by adults in young children, it is expected that children develop independence in these skills as they mature. </p>
            <p>Self care skills are one of the first ways that children develop the ability to plan and sequence task performance, to organize the necessary materials and to develop the refined physical control required to carry out daily tasks (be that to opening lunch boxes, drawing or standing to pull up pants). Thus self care skills act as precursors for many school related tasks as well as life skills. </p>

          <p>Organisation involves the ability to establish the tasks that you need to do, by when and how. Part of organisation is understanding the requirements of the task.</p>
          <p>Organisation is an important aspect in play, language, social interaction, personal management and academic task performance.
            Organisation is typically a skill that needs to be specifically modeled, supported by sensible structures (eg: pack away one toy/task before commencing another).
                        Organisation is important to develop a structured and consistent approach to tasks at all times</p>

          <h2><span style="color: #12c2b9;">handwriting </span> practice</h2>
          <p>Handwriting is a complex skill that develops over time. To learn handwriting, children need to combine fine motor skills, language, memory and concentration. They also need to practise and follow instructions.
            Handwriting starts with scribbling and drawing then moves on to forming letters, words and sentences.
    You can encourage your child to develop an interest in handwriting by giving them opportunities to draw, scribble and write. This prepares your child for the formal handwriting they’ll learn at school.</p>
          <p>Handwriting skills help children develop reading and spelling skills. Handwriting also helps with the ability to recall and remember information.

            And we need handwriting skills to do many tasks later in life, like writing birthday cards, filling in forms and signing important documents.</p>

          <h2><span style="color: #12c2b9;">Increase </span> Confidence</h2>
          <p>Confidence is an important aspect of childhood, a more confident child is more likely to partake in activities that are new or seem daunting to them. Poor participation can have a detrimental effect on the learning and development of new skills and tasks. It is therefore vital that children are given the opportunity to grow and develop their confidence and ability in a variety of occupations.</p>
          <p>variety of approaches to improve the confidence in your child, for example, by using an activity that increases the child's awareness of the things they are good at, rather than focussing on things they cant. Increasing confidence through activities can be done through a writing/drawing activity in which the child fills a shield with words and pictures of what they know they can do, and a sword filled with things they would like to do.</p>

          <h2><span style="color: #12c2b9;">Balance </span> & <span style="color: #12c2b9;">Coordination </span></h2>
          <p>Balance is the ability to maintain a controlled body position during task performance, whether it is sitting at a table, walking the balance beam or stepping up onto a kerb. To function effectively across environments and tasks, we need the ability to maintain controlled positions during both static (still) and dynamic (moving) activities.Static balance is the ability to hold a stationary position with control (e.g. “Freeze” or “statue” games). Dynamic balance is the ability to remain balanced while engaged in movement (e.g. running or bike riding).</p>
          <p>Age appropriate balance and coordination allows the child to be involved in the sports participation with a reasonable degree of success as it aids fluid body movement for physical skill performance (e.g. walking a balance beam or playing football). The involvement in sport is helpful in maintaining self regulation for daily tasks as well as developing a social network and achieving a sense of belonging in a community or social setting. It also helps children develop and maintain appropriate controlled body movement during task performance which, when effective, limits the energy required thus minimising fatigue.</p>
